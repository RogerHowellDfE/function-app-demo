# Demo of deploying function app

1. Create/identify the Azure resource group
2. Create user-managed system identities - these can persist
   - These identities will appear on Azure Portal as resources within the resource group
   - Create federated credential, linking that identity to the GitHub repository
     - `Organisation`: GitHub repository "owner" (i.e., individual username, or GitHub organisation)
     - `Repository`: GitHub repository "name" (i.e., the repo name)
     - `Entity`: `Environment`
       - (if scoping permissions to a GitHub "environment" - alternatively, can also be a specific branch/tag or generic "pull request")
     - `Environment`: `Development` / `Test` / `Production` (/anything which matches an "Environment" as defined on the GitHub repository)
   - Note: GitHub will create a cryptographically signed (public/private key crypto) request, validating that it is originating from GitHub in one of the above circumstances
     - ... this is, therefore, negating the need for any manual transferring (and management/rotating) of keys or secrets

3. Create the function app
   - Note: needs to be a premium SKU to allow deployment from a container registry
     - ... therefore _caution_ if creating this on a personal subscription (>Â£100 / month in costs(!))
   - Cheaper/development tiers allow only direct upload/deployment of function apps, and continuous deployment directly from a GitHub repository
4. Configure / link identity to the function app
   - On the function app, under "Access control (IAM)", add the role of "Website Contributor"

5. Note relevant Azure identifiers, and add them as environment "secrets"
   - Note they are not _strictly_ secrets due to the PKI crypto as described above (would need to steal/forge details to appear to Azure as if originating from GitHub)
   - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Specific to the user managed system identity
   - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Specific to the Azure AD/Entra tenant
   - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Specific to the subscription in which the function app/identity exist
7. Run the GitHub Action/Workflow
   - See this pipeline run for examples: https://github.com/RogerHowellDfE/function-app-demo/actions/runs/14022752616
   - If ODIC details above not supplied:
     - > ```
       > Run azure/login@v2
       > Error: Login failed with Error: Using auth-type: SERVICE_PRINCIPAL. Not all values are present. Ensure 'client-id' and 'tenant-id' are supplied.. Double check if the 'auth-type' is correct. Refer to https://github.com/Azure/login#readme for more information.
       > ```

   - If valid OIDC details supplied, but the managed identity has not been given "Website Contributor" role to a function app:
     - > ```
       > Run azure/login@v2
       >   with:
       >     client-id: ***
       >     tenant-id: ***
       >     subscription-id: ***

   - If valid OIDC details but invalid SKU for FA (needs premium SKU for linking to container registry) - login will succeed, but deploy will fail

8. Where deployment to a given environment has protection rules (e.g., required approvals), these will appear as execution of the action progresses
